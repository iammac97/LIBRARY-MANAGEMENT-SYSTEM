The library management system is designed to automate and enhance traditional library processes using Java for the backend, Java Swing for the user interface, and MySQL for the database.
The system features a robust database to store user and book details, a reliable search facility for users, an admin login for managing book transactions, and attractive user interfaces 
for seamless navigation.
Key features include advanced search options, filtering capabilities, and a quick search bar for instant access to specific books. **Administrators** have secure login access to add new books,
issue books to users, and process returns, all while updating book status. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and attractive, featuring a responsive
dashboard that displays a summary of available books, popular titles, and user borrowing history.
The statistics module provides a real-time overview of all issued books.
